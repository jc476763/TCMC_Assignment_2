            <h1>Townsville Community Music Center</h1>
            <span>General information about Townsville is available at -</br>
                <b> http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/townsville/infocentre/Pages/default.aspx</b></span>
            <p>Townsville has a population of about 200,000 and is growing at about 1 suburb per year, so there is a lot of musical activity. All private schools and most government schools have music teachers. The larger private schools are Townsville Grammar, the Cathedral School and Ryan Catholic College. The larger public high schools are Kirwan and Pimlico.</p>
            <p>The Townsville Community Music Centre was established in 1983 with the aim of fostering music in Townsville. In the beginning the focus was on promoting private music tuition and music education in schools. This battle was won many years ago and the focus has moved towards general assistance to local musicians, both amateur and professional.</p>
            <p>Currently, typical activities include hosting concerts and workshops, assisting musicians and other music organisations in promotions, communication, and funding, and acting as local agents for visiting professionals. Many of these activities simply would not happen without the support of the Music Centre.</p>
            <p>The Music Centre is a not-for-profit organisation, employs a part-time manager, and is based at its office at the Civic Theatre, Boundary Street, South Townsville.</p>
